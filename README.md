Multi-source learning via completion of block-wise overlapping noisy matrices (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10360)


## Data
In the paper, we used four different sources:

- 20 million notes at Stanford (Finlayson et al., 2014). The link to the preprocessed PMI matrix: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hcd50pf5z7pufau/ppmi.stan.concepts_perBin_30d.RData
-  10 million notes of 62K patients at Partners Healthcare System (PHS): the data is not shareable.
-  Health records from MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database (Johnson et al., 2016): the raw data can be obtained from https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/ but we are not allowed to distribute it. 
-  A Chinese PMI matrix from multiple sources including medical textbooks and Wikipedia: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9cxn8u8ahspt4xm/PPMI_Other8_window_10threshold_0weighted_0.rds
